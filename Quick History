After the creation of the realm, the greater god decided it needed shaping. They created 8 lesser beings than itself, each created with an ideology and a purpose. With its power spent it gave the instructions to his creation, "GO FORTH AND INHABIT THE LAND, MOLD IT AND MAKE IT THY OWN". 

With the greater presence gone each being went their own way and began to live. Some created life on a whim, learning the extent of their powers. Others went exploring, finding the raw lands best features. Others still looked for secrets or watched others. After many years life started to grow, become more coherent, and many had specific jobs. The dwarves to dig, the humans to farm and grow towns, the elves to scout the woods, the centaur to scout the plains, the giant to move the boulders. All life was in harmony, growning, molding the lands, and expanding. 

After countless years, the waves eroded the shore, the forest trees grew out, and the city walls widened. Space was becomming scarce and claims were starting to be made. WAR, inevitable; everyone progressing their object they felt was their god given right. WAR, lasting years; each side growing, new groteseque monstronsities. WAR, still not slowing;  the rate of the deaths now magic is given to all creations. WAR, needs an end; death needs rest, there is to more room in the after life. 

Awakening the creator was the only way Talbot could think to bring and end the madness. With no words spoken, time stopped and all the gods were brought togehter. "NEVER AGAIN". An edict was placed, no god shall have a physical form or be allowed to directly influnce the world again. 

Time started again, the fighting went on. After hours and days reinforments did not come, magic was slowly loosing impotence. Where are the gods?

Millenium Later
_____________________________________________________________
The gods are no longer here, do they even still hear our prayers? They must, miracles are still hapening and magic is still prevelent. Over the years the magic became not as powerful, and the miracles more rare. 

20 years ago a great war had been won after 5 years, resulting in a king being appointed over the realm. A great man of many rumors and tales, only a great man could lead all the realm's inhabitants.

Starting town
___________________________
A town built around a walled garrison, half way point between [[Ortou]] and [[Tolbolt Outpost]].  There has been a refereshed vigor for the area due to some activity in the outpost. An explosion opened a deep carvern in the quarry that holds something even the realm's king wants. With the news miners are coming and going more frequently. Knowledge seekers are coming to look at the cavern to find artifacts.
